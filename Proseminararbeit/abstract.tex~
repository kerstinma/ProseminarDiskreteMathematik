Semidefinite Programming (SDP), Facility Layout and Logistics have been very
active research areas over the last decades. SDP is the extension of 
linear programming to linear optimization over 
the cone of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices.
Facility layout is concerned with the optimal location of departments inside a plant 
according to a given objective function and logistics is the management of the
flow of goods between the point of origin and the point of consumption in
order to meet some requirements, for example, of customers or corporations. 

The main contributions of this thesis are the comparison of existing and the
design of new exact approaches based on linear, quadratic and
semidefinite relaxations for several 
facility layout and logistic problems. Facility layout problems discussed in
this thesis are the Single-Row Facility Layout Problem, the
$k$-Parallel Row Ordering Problem % , 
%the Space-Free Multi-Row Facility Layout Problem 
and the Multi-Row
Facility Layout Problem. These layout problems are of special interest for
optimizing flexible manufacturing systems. But they can also
be successfully applied to areas like sever design and typewriter keyboard
design. Additionally these layout problems arise in a large number of
applications in other diverse fields as logistics and scheduling. 

Up to now there existed quite diverse exact approaches to the various problem
types mentioned above. We
aim to highlight their connections and to  
present a unifying approach by showing that the proposed semidefinite model
based on products of ordering variables
can be successfully applied to many different layout problems. 
We show the
efficiency of our algorithm by providing extensive computational results for a
large variety of problem classes, solving many instances that have been
considered in the literature for years to optimality for the first
time. In particular we demonstrate that our semidefinite approach is the
strongest exact method to date for most row layout problems including the
Single-Row (Equidistant) Facility 
Layout Problem, the Multi-Row Equidistant Facility Layout Problem and several
variants of the general Multi-Row Facility Layout Problem. 

% As our semidefinite approach is applicable to both row and circular layout
% problems, we propose to optimize the layout of different cells Combined Cell
% Layout Problem 

Due to the generality of our SDP method, we can also use it to
simultaneously optimize over multiple machine cells exhibiting different
layout types. We formally define the corresponding Combined Cell Layout Problem
and indicate its theoretical and practical advantages.

Additionally three
new layout problems are introduced, namely the Directed Circular Facility
Layout Problem, the Checkpoint Ordering Problem and the weighted Linear
Ordering Problem. We indicate the relevance and applications of these new
problems and suggest both heuristic and exact methods for solving them.

% On the
% one hand we show 
% that the Directed Circular Facility Layout Problem contains several other
% relevant layout 
% problems as special cases and that it can be solved by both heuristic and
% exact methods more efficiently than the Single-Row Facility
% Layout Problem. On the other hand we reveal that the seemingly very easy
% Checkpoint Ordering Problem is in fact very hard to solve in practice.

Furthermore we concern ourselves with two variants of the famous Traveling Salesman
Problem. The Target Visitation Problem considers, additionally to the
distances travelled, preferences for visiting the different targets. We
propose a semidefinite formulation and demonstrate the 
efficiency of our approach on a variety of benchmark instances.
We also conduct a polyhedral study of the corresponding polytope,
improving a semidefinite relaxation proposed by Newman. While the Target
Visitation Problem  has
applications in environmental assessment, combat search and rescue and
disaster relief, we suggest another variant of the Traveling Salesman
Problem with applications in 
beam melting. We examine the length and structure of the optimal 
traveling salesman tours considering different types of forbidden
neighborhoods on grid graphs.

From an algorithmic point of view the core of the approach used most
frequently in this thesis is to approximately 
solve tight SDP 
relaxations for the different layout and logistic problems mentioned above by 
using a dynamic version of the bundle method
in conjunction with interior point 
methods. The resulting fractional solutions 
constitute lower bounds for the problems. 
By the use of the hyperplane rounding algorithm of
Goemans-Williamson together with an appropriate repair strategy,
we can exploit such fractional solutions to 
obtain upper bounds, i.e., integer 
feasible solutions that describe a feasible layout of the departments or
feasible tours respectively. Hence, in
the end we have some feasible solution, 
together with a certificate of how far this solution could possibly be from
the true optimum. 

In summary we extend the application area of
semidefinite and combinatorial optimization in facility layout
and logistics through the design of 
new optimization problems and the development of efficient algorithmic frameworks based
on semidefinite (and linear) programming.
